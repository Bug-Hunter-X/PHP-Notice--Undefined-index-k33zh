# PHP Notice: Undefined index

This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: "Notice: Undefined index".  The error occurs when trying to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist.  The code includes a faulty function that handles various input types, but doesn't properly handle null values.  This leads to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

The solution shows how to properly check for the existence of array keys before accessing them, thus preventing the "Undefined index" notice.  Always prioritize robust error handling and input validation for cleaner, more reliable PHP code.
